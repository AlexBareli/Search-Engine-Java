Search Engine
=================================================

This is a Search Engine Project in Java that uses an Inverted Index to parse, stem, and store a bunch of words, which can then be accessed and searched to get the most likely links. Also implemenets a basic jetty webserver to display an html page for interacting with the search engine.
